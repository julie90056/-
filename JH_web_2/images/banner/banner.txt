The Quest of Watchmakers
Constant Escapement L.M.
Constancy (in the sense of constant force) is a permanent quest for watchmakers. At Girard-Perregaux, this horological ‘holy grail’ has become a reality. Presented in 2008, the Constant Escapement revolutionised the very foundations of chronometry. Ten years after this major breakthrough that won the prestigious “Aiguille d’Or” award in the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève, Girard-Perregaux introduces a new Constant Escapement L.M. model featuring a design that is more technical and contemporary than ever.

The heiress to the pocket-watch La Esmeralda was granted the prize of the Tourbillon during the ceremony of the GPHG 2016.
